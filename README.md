# TreeFriends
Introducing our app, a vital tool for urbanites to safeguard the green heart of our cities.

As our urban landscape grows, public trees face challenges like restricted roots and compacted soils, especially during extreme droughts and heats. Our app is the solution, notifying residents near public trees to water them when they need it most. Real-time alerts guide users to specific locations, providing details on each tree's unique needs. 
By empowering citizens with knowledge and fostering community involvement, our app ensures the well-being of urban greenery.
